## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned about using multiple background images on one element and positioning them separately.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Multiple Backgrounds](https://www.w3schools.com/Css/css3_backgrounds.asp) - This explains how to use multiple backgrounds on an element.
- [Background Position](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-position) - This taught me the syntax for adjusting background position.
- [Media Queries: Orientation](https://drafts.csswg.org/mediaqueries/#orientation) - I decided to change the sizes of the circles in the background based on the width-to-height ratio of the viewport. This resource informed me that you do that via the viewport orientation media query.
